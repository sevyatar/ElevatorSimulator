The elevator simulator can deal with 3 different types of elevators - 

1. Naive Elevator:
This elevator has 1 button outside, and the rider chooses his destination floor once he walks into the elevator.

2. Up-Down Button Elevator:
This elevator has 2 buttons outside - an up and a down button. The rider chooses his destination floor once he walks into the elevator.


3. Destination-First Elevator:
In this elevator, the rider inputs his destination floor before getting into the elevator.


For every elevator type, the simulator can handle any number of elevators that work simultaneously.
